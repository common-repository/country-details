Just another country details plugin. Simple but flexible.

== Description ==

Get information about any country on mouse move over the country using a simple short code, for ex: [countrydetails country="India"].

= Docs & Support =

As this is our first wordpress plugin we are still in the process of creating all the collaterals of the plugin, we will update all the information once the documents are ready.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `country details` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

You will find no menu in your WordPress admin panel but just use the shortcode [countrydetails country="country name"].

== Screenshots ==

1. screenshot-1.png is an example taken from the wordpress widgets where the shortcode is used to display the country "Cuba" in the footer, when the visitor mouse moveover the Cuba word the detailed scroller will popup.
